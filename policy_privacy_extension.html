        <h1 class="mb-4">Privacy Policy for Extension</h1>
        
        <p>Your extension for the Chrome browser is seriously referred to as confidentiality. This confidentiality policy describes what data we collect, how we use it, and what measures we take to protect them.</p>
        
        <h2 class="mt-4">Data Collection</h2>
        
        <h3 class="mt-3">1. Local Storage (storage):</h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Memorizing the selection of a user between displaying prices for gold and silver per ounce or per gram.</p>
        <p><strong>Information Collected:</strong> Your extension saves only the preferences of the user (the choice of metal and unit of measurement) in the local storage of the browser. This information is not transmitted or stored on our servers or third-party services.</p>
        
        <h3 class="mt-3">2. API Requests:</h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Obtaining current prices for gold and silver.</p>
        <p><strong>Information Collected:</strong> Requests for receiving gold and silver prices are carried out directly from the extension to the API. These requests do not contain and do not transmit any personal information of the user.</p>
        
        <h2 class="mt-4">Data Usage</h2>
        
        <p><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Information saved in the local storage is used exclusively to improve user experience, allowing you to display the price of gold or silver in a unit measurement convenient for them.</p>
        <p><strong>API Requests:</strong> Actual data on gold and silver prices are requested and displayed in real-time by the extension.</p>
        
        <h2 class="mt-4">Data Protection</h2>
        
        <p>We take all the necessary measures to ensure the security of the user data:</p>
        <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All data is stored locally in the user browser and never transmitted to external servers.</p>
        <p><strong>Safety of API Requests:</strong> Requests to the API are protected by standard security protocols.</p>
        
        <h2 class="mt-4">Changes in Privacy Policy</h2>
        
        <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy. We will notify users about any changes through extension updates and publishing a new version of the Privacy Policy on our website.</p>
        
        <h2 class="mt-4">Contact Information</h2>
